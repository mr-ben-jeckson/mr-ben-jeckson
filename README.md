# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Fullstack Web Developer with 6 years of experience in the field. I specialize in PHP frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter, as well as working with raw PHP. On the frontend, I'm adept at using various JavaScript frameworks, including Vue and React.

## Professional Background

My journey in web development began in 2017 when I started as an entry-level developer at Peace House Travel Management. Over the years, I've evolved into a freelancer, taking on diverse projects that have honed my skills in e-commerce backend services, cloud storage management, and ERP systems for hotel management, HR, and point of sale (POS).

## Notable Project

One of my major accomplishments is the development of an airline reservation system. This system is seamlessly integrated with global payment gateways, including 2c2p, Kasikorn Bank, and PayPal. The project involved ensuring secure transactions and a smooth user experience.

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm working on a logistics solution that involves flexible data for Google mapping and kilometers distance calculation. The system also incorporates real-time notifications, enhancing its efficiency and user responsiveness.
